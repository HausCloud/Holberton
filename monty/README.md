# Monty Bytecode
Project to create interpreter for Monty ByteCode files


# Description / Motivation
The objective of this project was to understand LIFO (Last In First Out) and FIFO (First In First Out). The interpreter is supposed to read from a file line by line and interpret each one in the  previously stated context.

# Learning Objectives
* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* What is the proper way to use global variables
* How to work with git submodules


# Usage
* Compile all C files with recommended flags
* Run a.out executable with bytecode file as argument
```
$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra *.c
$ ./a.out bytecodes/00.m
```
