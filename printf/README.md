# Proto _printf
First partner project in Holberton School curriculum to create simple printf prototype.


# Description / Motivation
The main goal of this project was to create a prototype of the commonly used printf function. This was the first project in which we had partners which increased the level of complexity needed to complete said project. Collaboration was crucial and our scores were based on a 40/60 commit ratio. The main difficulties at the time were to understand string interpretation, function pointers, and variadic arguments.
