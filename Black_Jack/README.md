# Black Jack
A side project to create a console black jack game

# Description / Motivation
What was originally a passing thought during a peer learning day has now come into fruition. This project was mainly to see how quickly we could pick up a programming language using our fundamental understanding of coding. Everything was unintentionally made more complicated using objects to create a virtual deck. However, certain behaviors of the Javascript language were discovered through this complication and provided a better understanding of the language.

# Usage
```
$ ./black_jack.js
```

# Technology
* Javascript (tested on node js 10)
